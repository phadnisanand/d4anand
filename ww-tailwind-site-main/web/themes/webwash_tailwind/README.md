1. Use the correct Node.js version:
   ```bash
   nvm use
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install
   ```

### Development

## Single Directory Components (SDC)

This theme uses Drupal's Single Directory Components architecture. Each component is self-contained in its own directory with:
- Component definition (`.component.yml`)
- Twig template (`.twig`)
- Styles (imported into Vite build)
- Documentation (`README.md`)

Components are located in the `/components` directory.
